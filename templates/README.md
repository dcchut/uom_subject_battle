uom subject battle
###########

My first experiment with web development in python - the idea is that people vote on subjects offered at uom, with rankings being done using an ELO based system.

* [uom subject battle](http://dj.nitrated.net) -- the battle itself
* [dcchut](http://dcc.nitrated.net/) -- my personal site
